Question 1.
A(1,2,3)
B(10, 200, -90)
C(1.4, 2.3, 55.9)
Answer bellow questions: (round all the number to two digits)
    1. dis(A,B) -----> dis_AB
    2. dis(B,C) -----> dis_BC
    3. dis(A,C) -----> dis_AC
    4. form a list (lis_dis) consisting of all the distance
    5. Sort the lis_dis as descending order, what is the maximium distanxe, the minimium distance, and average distance.
    6. construct a list(lis_key) of keys, 'AB', 'BC', 'AC', and a list(lis_val) of value which is the corresponding distance of the keys.
    7. construct a dictionary(dic_dis) of distance from the lis_key and lis_val
    8. return the items, keys, and values of dic_dis
    9. return the distance of AB, BC, and AC from dic_dis
